### <div id="gamemech">GAME MECHANICS</div>

- User adds a task by simply sending a text message to the bot (the text is the task itself), this makes them part of the game and they get 100% HP along with 0 Coins and 0 Mana.

- Various [task-actions](#task-actions) have varied effects on the Player's HP and Coins:

	- Completing a task (`Done`) will increase the Player's Coins by a random value between 1-5
	- Not completing a task (`Missed`) will decrease the Player's HP by a random value between 10-20
	- `Postponed` task will decrease the Player's Coins by a random value between 1-3

- Coins can be used to purchase Mana Potion from the shop. The Mana determines a Player's position in the leaderboard.

- If a Player's HP reaches 0, the Player's Coins and Mana are reset to 0 and HP is reset to 100%.

- the `/status` command can be used to generate a player report with all their relevant information including their [rank](#ranking-system).

- Many elements of the bot are inspired by the Japanese anime _Mairimashita! Iruma-kun_.
#### <div id='ranking-system'>Ranking System:</div>
The ranking system works separately from the leaderboard. The rank of the player is also based on their Mana. This system is based on the Gematria system.

<table>
<tr><th>Rank</th><th>Required Mana</th></tr>
<tr><td>Unranked</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Aleph</td><td>90</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bet</td><td>178</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gimmel</td><td>266</td></tr>
<tr><td>Daleth</td><td>354</td></tr>
</table>

#### <div id='task-actions'>Task-Actions:</div>
- [‚úÖ](button_id_1): Marks the task as done.
- [‚ùé](button_id_2): Marks the task as Missed.

## Notes:
### Plugins System:
I've tried to add a plugins system in which new plugins can be directly added to `todoer/plugins` folder, and imported in `main.py`. Plugins like Item Shop, Pet Shop etc. can be added that way.
However, Plugin System requires a lot more testing.

### Logging:
There is next to no logging in the app (not even print statements). That is because I've never done logging before since all my programs used to be smaller in scale and print statements got the job done, but since this is a large scale program (with plugins and everything), I plan on implementing proper logging in the app as soon as possible.

### Design Pattern:
There is no design pattern and I'd really appreciate any advice regarding that. I understand that the structure of the program is not sustainable but I don't have any idea what to begin with.
